# Project_Medicine_Finder
I'd be glad to create a comprehensive README file for your Flask-based medical store application:

## medical_store_finder

This Flask application facilitates the management of medical stores, medicines, and user access. It caters to three user roles:

* **Admin:** Manages the overall system, including registering medical stores and user accounts.
* **Medical Store Manager:** Registers medicines available in their store.
* **Guest:** Searches for specific medicines across registered stores (without login).

**Project Structure:**

* **app:** Contains the core application code (models, routes, logic).
* **migrations:** Stores database schema changes (if using MySQL).
* **static:** Holds static assets like CSS and JavaScript files.
* **templates:** Stores HTML templates used for rendering dynamic content.

**Prerequisites:**

* Python 3.x ([https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/))
* pip (usually included with Python installation)
* Flask ([https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.2.x/))
* Flask-SQLAlchemy ([https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/](https://flask-sqlalchemy.palletsprojects.com/en/2.x/))
* Flask-Login ([https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/](https://flask-login.readthedocs.io/en/latest/))
* MySQL database ([https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/))

**Installation:**

1. Clone this repository: `git clone https://your_repository_url.git`
2. Create a virtual environment (recommended for managing dependencies):
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # macOS/Linux
   source venv/Scripts/activate  # Windows
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install Flask Flask-SQLAlchemy Flask-Login pymysql
   ```

**Configuration:**

1. Create a MySQL database and configure the connection details in your Flask application (typically in a configuration file).
2. Define database models for users, medical stores, and medicines in the `app` directory.

**Development Setup:**

1. Open the project directory in your preferred IDE.
2. Run the application (specific command depends on your setup):
   ```bash
   flask run
   ```
   This typically starts a development server at a local address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`).

**Functionality:**

* **Admin:**
   - Registers new medical stores.
   - Manages user accounts (admins, medical store managers).
* **Medical Store Manager:**
   - Creates an account and associates with a registered store.
   - Registers medicines available in their store, including details like name, price, and quantity.
* **Guest:**
   - Searches for specific medicines across registered stores using a search bar on the home page.
   - Views availability information for the medicine at different stores (without login).

**Authentication and Authorization:**

* Utilizes Flask-Login to manage user authentication and authorization.
* Securely stores user credentials (hashed passwords).
* Employs session keys to restrict access based on user roles. Admins and Medical Store Managers can access additional functionalities.

**Database (MySQL):**

* Leverages Flask-SQLAlchemy to interact with the MySQL database.
* Database models represent users, medical stores, and medicines with relevant attributes.

**Deployment:**

* For production deployment, consider using a web server like Gunicorn or uWSGI alongside a WSGI server (e.g., Nginx or Apache).
* Configure the server to serve the application from the appropriate location (containing the main application file).

**Further Development:**

* Implement features like:
   - User accounts for medical store managers (login/logout).
   - Advanced search options (e.g., by category, brand).
   - Inventory management for medical stores.
* Enhance the user interface for a better user experience.

**Contributions:**

Feel free to fork this repository and contribute your improvements through pull requests. Adhere to best practices for code formatting and commenting.

**Disclaimer:**

This is a basic structure and implementation outline. You'll need to fill in the specific details of your application logic, database interactions, authentication flow, UI design, and error handling in the corresponding code files.
